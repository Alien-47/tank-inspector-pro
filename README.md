Tank Inspector PRO project was launched with a crowd-funding project at [indiegogo]. It was originally designed as a commercial service program, however the developers decided to make it free and open source.

## Getting Started
### For Normal Users
Tank Inspector PRO is in its alpha stage, it's not fully functional yet, however most of its features are working well. For now we don't have a binary release, but it is still possible to grab the source code and build yourself.

### For Programmers
This repository contains the full source of Tank Inspector PRO, organized in a Visual Studio 2015 solution. You will need .NET Framework 4.0 and DirectX 9.0 installed on your computer. All other referenced third-party libraries are included in the respository (under the Libraries folder), so generally you can clone the source code and build with the Smellyriver.TankInspector.Pro.sln file.

### Usage
We don't have wizards nor guidiance made in the program, so it is still a bit of difficult to use. Generally, you will need to add a game client by clicking the **Add** button on the top-left corner of the **Game Clients** page, which should be shown on the first time you run Tank Inspector PRO. After that, you can use the **Game Client Explorer** and **Museum** panel to find tanks. You can view tank stats, models and armor schemas by right-clicking a tank - practically everything could be found in menus, try to explore it.

## Contribute!
Tank Inspector PRO is in its alpha stage, it's not fully functional yet. You are most welcome to contribute and improve this program.
